  Scenario: Move a question between categories via the question page
    When I am on the "Course 1" "core_question > course question bank" page logged in as "teacher1"
    And I set the field "Select a category" to "Used category"
    And I click on "Test question to be moved" "checkbox" in the "Test question to be moved" "table_row"
    And I click on "With selected" "button"
    And I click on question bulk action "move"
    And I set the field "Question category" to "Subcategory"
    And I press "Move to"
    Then I should see "Test question to be moved"
    And the field "Select a category" matches value "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subcategory (1)"
    And the "Select a category" select box should contain "Used category"
    And the "Select a category" select box should not contain "Used category (1)"
