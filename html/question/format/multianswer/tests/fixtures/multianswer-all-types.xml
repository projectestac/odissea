<h5>NUMERICAL and SHORTANSWER</h5>
<p>Let's start easy. Water freezes at 0°C and {1:NUMERICAL:=32:0#Must be exact} Farenheit. But, do you know that water is boiling at {1:NUMERICAL:=212:0#Exact~%50%212:10#Close, you get at least half the points.} Fahrenkeit?</p>

<p>Fahrnheit lived some years before Celcius. You may have noticed already that the spelling of the scientist was different every time he was mentioned. Please spell his name correctly: {1:SHORTANSWER:=Fahrenheit#That's correct.}</p>
