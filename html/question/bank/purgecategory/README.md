Installation

Copy the purgecategory folder into your Moodle /question/bank directory and visit your Admin Notification page to complete the installation.

Usage
-----
Question bank navigation node will be extended with "Purge categories" item. Select category you want to delete and specify where to 
move questions, that cannot be deleted. Questions, that cannot be deleted, are questions, that are used in quizes or in history of quiz
attempts. Such questions will be moved to specified categories and marked as hidden. This can be useful if you are importing a lot of 
questions with many categories and want to delete all of them and reimport them.
