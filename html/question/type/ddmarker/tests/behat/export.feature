  @javascript
  Scenario: Export a drag and drop markers question
    When I am on the "Course 1" "core_question > course question export" page logged in as teacher
    And I set the field "id_format_xml" to "1"
    And I press "Export questions to file"
    Then following "click here" should download between "233700" and "233950" bytes
    # If the download step is the last in the scenario then we can sometimes run
    # into the situation where the download page causes a http redirect but behat
    # has already conducted its reset (generating an error). By putting a logout
    # step we avoid behat doing the reset until we are off that page.
    And I log out
