============================================
The Ordering question type for Moodle >= 2.9
============================================

The ordering question type displays several items in a random order
which the user then drags into the correct sequential order.

    * an ordering question can display all items or a subset of items

    * items can be plain text or formatted HTML, including text,
      images, audio and video.

    * items can be listed vertically or horizontally

    * several grading methods are available, ranging from a simple
      all-or-nothing grade, to more complex partial grades that
      consider the placement of each item relative to other items

Development history and credits
============================================

This plugin was originally developed by Thomas Robb (Kyoto Sangyo University, Japan)
and Serafim Panov for the ordering questions in the Reader activity module for Moodle 1.x.

Moodle 2.x development was passed to Gordon Bateson (Kochi University of Technology, Japan)
funded by the Moodle Association of Japan, with partial funding from Sapporo Gakuin University.

Coding enhancements and standardization in preparation for future merging into Moodle core
were undertaken by Vadim Dvorovenko (Kemerovo State University of Culture and Arts, Russia).

Development of "relative to correct" grading method commissioned by Anatoliy Markiv and
sponsored by Kings College London, UK.

Code for privacy, automatic testing, keyboard interaction (for accessibility) and 
standardization of Javascript to extend standard Moodle's Drag-and_Drop was added 
by Tim Hunt and Mahmoud Kassaei of Open University, UK.

Thanks also to Dominique Bauer (ETS, University of Quebec, Canada) for his help and ideas
in testing the "Item selection type" and "Grading type", particularly the "Longest
ordered/contiguous subset" grading type.

many thanks to all concerned!
