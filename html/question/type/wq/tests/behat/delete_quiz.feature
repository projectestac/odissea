Scenario: Delete "Wiris Quiz" from the course and verify Question bank still holds the 4 questions
    Given I am logged in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    When I delete "Wiris Quiz" activity
    # Check the question bank is unaffected.
    When I navigate to "Question bank" in current page administration
    Then I should see "TF WIRIS – sky color"
    And I should see "Multichoice Wiris"
    And I should see "Essay Wiris"
    And I should see "Match Wiris"
    # Optional stricter check (if available in your UI):
    # And I should see "4" in the "qb-num-questions" "css_element"
