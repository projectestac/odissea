This file describes API changes in /question/type/calculated/*.

=== 4.3 ===
* \qtype_calculated answers are now of the type \qtype_calculated\qtype_calculated_answer which extends \qtype_numerical_answer.
  Plugins extending \qtype_calculated and still reference \qtype_numerical_answer in their code (e.g. in test helper functions)
  should update their code to reference \qtype_calculated\qtype_calculated_answer instead.
