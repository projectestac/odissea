    <p>You can use your current e-mail address or sign up for a free Windows Live e-mail address. The choice is yours. Keep in mind that some features are only available for certain e-mail accounts. For example, e-mail access is limited to Hotmail, MSN&reg;, and Live addresses. </p>
    <h3 id="Moodle4">How do I link my Moodle account to my Windows Live ID? </h3>
    <p>This may have been done for you already by your Moodle administrator. If not, you can link your Moodle and Windows Live ID accounts together with the following steps:

<br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong> If you don\'t already have a Windows Live ID, you\'ll need to sign up for one before continuing.
<br/>To link your Moodle and Windows Live ID accounts together:
<ol>
<li>Log into Moodle.</li>
<li>Click your name in the upper-right corner to view your account.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Edit Profile.</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>Show Advanced.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>MSN ID</strong> field, enter your Windows Live ID.</li>

<li>Click <strong>Update Profile.</strong></li>
</ol>
</p>
    <h3 id="Moodle5">What should I do if I can\'t sign in? </h3>
    <p>If you can\'t sign into Moodle with your Windows Live ID, try the following:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that your whole e-mail address (before and after the @ sign) is entered in the <strong>Email address</strong> field. </li>

<li>Make sure that you entered your password correctly. Passwords are case sensitive. If you\'ve forgotten your password, try to reset it. </li>
<li>If you haven\'t used your Hotmail or MSN e-mail address for a long time, it may be deactivated. If your account was deactivated, <a href=\\"http://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&rpsnv=10&ct=1244735143&rver=5.5.4177.0&wp=MBI&wreply=http://mail.live.com/default.aspx&lc=1033&id=64855&mkt=en-US\\" target=\\"_blank\\">visit the Hotmail registration Web site</a> to open a new account. </li>
<li>Your user name may become unavailable if it doesn\'t include msn or hotmail domain after the @ sign, and you haven\'t used the account for more than a year. To sign up for new credentials, visit the Windows Live ID Web site. </li>
<li>Make sure that you have configured your browser to allow cookies. If your browser doesn\'t allow cookies, you can\'t sign in with your Windows Live ID. </li>
<li>See if there is an error message telling you that the network is temporarily out of service.</li>
</ul>
 </p>
   <h2>Windows Live Services</h2>

    <h3 id="WLS1">What Windows Live services can I use from my Moodle?</h3>
    <p>The Microsoft Live Services Plug-in for Moodle provides access to Windows Live Mail, Calendar, Messenger, Alerts, and Bing search.<br/><br/>
Note: If Windows Live services are not available from your Moodle site, then your Moodle administrator may not have installed this option. </p>
    <h3 id="WLS2">Why can\'t I access my e-mail?</h3>
    <p>If you signed up for a Windows Live ID using an e-mail address that isn\'t from Hotmail, Live, or MSN, you cannot access e-mail within Moodle. </p>
    <h3 id="WLS3">If I can\'t access my e-mail, can I maintain a contacts list? </h3>

    <p>Yes, even if you don\'t have full access to your e-mail, you will still be able to maintain a contacts list using your Windows Live ID.</p>
    <h3 id="WLS4">Is Windows Live Calendar available to everyone with a Windows Live ID?</h3>
    <p>Yes, the Windows Live Calendar is available to all Windows Live ID accounts.</p>

    <h3 id="WLS6">Why can\'t I send instant messages to my classmates? </h3>

    <p>Make sure you\'ve added your classmates to your contacts list for Windows Live Messenger. You and your classmates may have to update your Windows Live Messenger Web settings to allow people to see your presence before you can see and chat with each other.</p>
    <h3 id="WLS7">How do I turn on my presence in Windows Live Messenger?</h3>
    <p>To turn presence on:<br/>
<ol>
<li>Open <a href=\\"http://settings.messenger.live.com/applications/websettings.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Windows Live Messenger Web Settings.</a></li>

<li>Click <strong>Allow anyone on the web to see my presence and send me messages.</strong></li>

<li>Click <strong>Save.</strong></li>
</ol></p>
    <h3 id="WLS8">Why do I appear to be offline when my Windows Live Messenger presence is enabled?</h3>
    <p>In order to appear online to your classmates, make sure:
<ul>
<li>You have Windows Live Messenger running and you are signed in. (If Windows Live Messenger is not available to you, then your Moodle administrator may not have installed this option.)</li>
<li>Your classmates have added you to their contacts list and you have accepted their invitation.</li>
<li>You have updated your settings to allow people to see your presence.</li>
</ul>

</p>
    <h3 id="WLS9">What is a Windows Live Alert?</h3>
    <p>An alert is a message that is broadcast to a group of teachers and students. Alerts can be delivered to your e-mail, Windows Live Messenger, and mobile device. When you subscribe to Windows Live Alerts, you can set your preferred delivery methods.</p>
    <h3 id="WLS10">Who can send a Windows Live Alert?</h3>
    <p>Teachers within a Moodle course can send alerts to the students enrolled in that course.</p>

    <h3 id="WLS11">Who can receive a Windows Live Alert?</h3>
    <p>If you have subscribed to Windows Live Alerts, and you <strong>subscribe for alerts for a particular course</strong>, you can receive alerts sent by the teacher of that course.</p>
    <h3 id="WLS12">Can I send a Windows Live Alert to an individual student?</h3>
    <p>No, at this time Windows Live Alerts can only be sent to all subscribers in the same course.</p>
    <h3 id="WLS13">Why did my course alerts suddenly stop working?</h3>

    <p>If the Moodle administrator changes the short name used for the course, existing alert subscriptions for that course will stop working. To continue receiving alerts for the course, you\'ll need to subscribe to the course alerts again.</p>
