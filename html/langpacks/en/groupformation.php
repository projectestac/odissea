        The further settings allow you to specify the group size and/or preknowledge of the participants. If the preknowledges of participants should complement to each other,
        you can specify it in the settings.

        A preview of the questonnaire can be found later on by opening the activity as a docent.<br>

        The further settings allow you to specify the group size and/or preknowledge of the participants. If the preknowledges of participants
         should complement to each other,
        you can specify it in the settings.
        2.) The participants get the questionnaire which is based on your settings. You can set the period when the questionnaire is available(see step 1).
        A preview of the questonnaire can be found later on by opening the activity as a docent.<br>
        3.) The statistics to the answers can be found by opening the activity. If you are sutisfied with the response, you can start the groupformation manualy(it never happens automatically).<br>
