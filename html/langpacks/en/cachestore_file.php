Enabling this will speed up file interactions but comes at the cost of increased risk of hitting file system limitations.

It is advisable to only turn this on if the following is true:

* If you know the number of items in the cache is going to be small enough that it won\'t cause issues on the file system you are running with.
* The data being cached is not expensive to generate. If it is then sticking with the default may still be the better option as it reduces the chance of issues.';
