Feature: View activity completion information in the LTI activity
  In order to have visibility of LTI completion requirements
  As a student
  I need to be able to view my LTI completion progress

  Scenario: View automatic completion items as a teacher
    Given I am on the "Music history" "lti activity" page logged in as teacher1
    Then "Music history" should have the "Receive a grade" completion condition
    And "Music history" should have the "View" completion condition

  @javascript
  Scenario: View automatic completion items as a student
    Given I am on the "Music history" "lti activity" page logged in as student1
    And the "View" completion condition of "Music history" is displayed as "done"
    And the "Receive a grade" completion condition of "Music history" is displayed as "todo"
    And I am on the "Course 1" course page logged in as teacher1
    And I navigate to "View > Grader report" in the course gradebook
    And I turn editing mode on
    And I give the grade "90.00" to the user "Vinnie Student1" for the grade item "Music history"
    And I press "Save changes"
    When I am on the "Music history" "lti activity" page logged in as student1
    Then the "Receive a grade" completion condition of "Music history" is displayed as "done"
    And the "View" completion condition of "Music history" is displayed as "done"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Use manual completion
    Given I am on the "Music history" "lti activity editing" page logged in as teacher1
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I set the field "Completion tracking" to "Students can manually mark the activity as completed"
    And I press "Save and display"
    # Teacher view.
    And the manual completion button for "Music history" should be disabled
    # Student view.
    When I am on the "Music history" "lti activity" page logged in as student1
    Then the manual completion button of "Music history" is displayed as "Mark as done"
    And I toggle the manual completion state of "Music history"
    And the manual completion button of "Music history" is displayed as "Done"
