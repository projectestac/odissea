  Scenario: A student can manually mark the quiz activity as done but a teacher cannot
    Given I am on the "Test quiz name" "quiz activity" page logged in as teacher1
    And the manual completion button for "Test quiz name" should be disabled
    And I log out
    # Student view.
    When I am on the "Test quiz name" "quiz activity" page logged in as student1
    Then the manual completion button of "Test quiz name" is displayed as "Mark as done"
    And I toggle the manual completion state of "Test quiz name"
    And the manual completion button of "Test quiz name" is displayed as "Done"
