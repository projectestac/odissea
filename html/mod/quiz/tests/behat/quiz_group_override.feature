  Scenario: Override Group 1 as teacher of Group 1
    Given the following "permission overrides" exist:
      | capability                  | permission | role           | contextlevel | reference |
      | moodle/site:accessallgroups | Prevent    | editingteacher | Course       | C1        |
    When I am on the "Test quiz" "mod_quiz > Group overrides" page logged in as "teacher1"
    And I press "Add group override"
    Then the "Override group" select box should contain "Group 1"
    And the "Override group" select box should not contain "Group 2"

  Scenario: Add button disabled if there are no groups
    Given the following "permission overrides" exist:
      | capability                  | permission | role           | contextlevel | reference |
      | moodle/site:accessallgroups | Prevent    | editingteacher | Course       | C1        |
    When I am on the "Test quiz" "mod_quiz > Group overrides" page logged in as "teacher3"
    Then I should see "No groups you can access."
    And the "Add group override" "button" should be disabled

  Scenario: A teacher can create an override
    When I am on the "Test quiz" "mod_quiz > Group overrides" page logged in as "teacher1"
    And I press "Add group override"
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Override group   | Group 1 |
      | Attempts allowed | 2       |
    And I press "Save and enter another override"
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Override group   | Group 3 |
      | Attempts allowed | 2       |
    And I press "Save"
    Then "Group 1" "table_row" should exist
    # Check all column headers are present.
    And I should see "Group" in the "Overrides" "table_row"
    And I should see "Action" in the "Overrides" "table_row"

  Scenario: A teacher with accessallgroups permission should see all group overrides
    Given the following "mod_quiz > group overrides" exist:
      | quiz      | group | attempts |
      | Test quiz | G1    | 2        |
      | Test quiz | G2    | 2        |
    When I am on the "Test quiz" "mod_quiz > View" page logged in as "teacher1"
    Then I should see "Settings overrides exist (Groups: 2)"
    And I follow "Groups: 2"
    And "Group 1" "table_row" should exist
    And "Group 2" "table_row" should exist

  Scenario: A teacher without accessallgroups permission should only see the group overrides within his/her groups, when the activity's group mode is "separate groups"
    Given the following "permission overrides" exist:
      | capability                  | permission | role           | contextlevel | reference |
      | moodle/site:accessallgroups | Prevent    | editingteacher | Course       | C1        |
    And the following "mod_quiz > group overrides" exist:
      | quiz      | group | attempts |
      | Test quiz | G1    | 2        |
      | Test quiz | G2    | 2        |
    When I am on the "Test quiz" "mod_quiz > View" page logged in as "teacher1"
    Then I should see "Settings overrides exist (Groups: 1) for your groups"
    And I follow "Groups: 1"
    Then "Group 1" "table_row" should exist
    And "Group 2" "table_row" should not exist

  Scenario: A non-editing teacher can see the overrides, but not change them
    Given the following "mod_quiz > group overrides" exist:
      | quiz      | group | attempts |
      | Test quiz | G1    | 2        |
      | Test quiz | G2    | 2        |
    When I am on the "Test quiz" "mod_quiz > Group overrides" page logged in as "helper"
    Then "Group 1" "table_row" should exist
    And "Group 2" "table_row" should exist
    And "Add group override" "button" should not exist
    And "Edit" "link" should not exist in the "Group 1" "table_row"
    And "Copy" "link" should not exist in the "Group 1" "table_row"
    And "Delete" "link" should not exist in the "Group 1" "table_row"
