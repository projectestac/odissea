# PURPOSE
The Attendance module allows teachers to maintain a record of attendance, replacing or supplementing a paper-based attendance register.
It is primarily used in blended-learning environments where students are required to attend classes, lectures and tutorials and allows
the teacher to track and optionally provide a grade for the students attendance.

Sessions can be configured to allow students to record their own attendance and a range of different reports are available.
