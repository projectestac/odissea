  In order to collect feedbacks
  As an teacher
  I need to be able to create and collect feedbacks

  Background:

    And the following "courses" exist:

      | Course 1 | C1        |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:

    When I am on the "Site feedback" "feedback activity" page logged in as manager
    And I click on "Edit questions" "link" in the "[role=main]" "css_element"
    And I add a "Multiple choice" question to the feedback with:
      | Question                       | Do you like our site?              |
      | Label                          | multichoice2                       |
      | Multiple choice type           | Multiple choice - single answer    |
      | Hide the "Not selected" option | Yes                                |
