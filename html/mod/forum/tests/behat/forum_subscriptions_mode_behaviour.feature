    And the following "activity" exists:
      | activity         | forum                  |
      | idnumber         | f01                    |
      | course           | C1                     |

      | forcesubscribe   | 1                      |

  Scenario: A change from Forced subscription to Auto subcription causes all participants to be subscribed
    Given I am on the "Test forum name" "forum activity" page logged in as teacher
    And I navigate to "Subscriptions" in current page administration
    When I select "Auto subscription" from the "Subscription mode" singleselect
    Then I should not see "There are no subscribers yet for this forum"
    And I navigate to "Subscriptions" in current page administration
    And the following should exist in the "subscribers-table" table:
      | Full name | Email address |
      | Student 1 | student.1@example.com |
      | Student 2 | student.2@example.com |
      | Teacher Tom | teacher@example.com |
