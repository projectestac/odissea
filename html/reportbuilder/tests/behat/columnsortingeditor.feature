Feature: Manage custom report columns sorting
  In order to manage the sorting for columns of custom reports
  As an admin
  I need to be able to enable/disable, change sort direction and reorder sorting for columns

  Background:
    Given the following "core_reportbuilder > Reports" exist:
      | name      | source                                   | default |
      | My report | core_user\reportbuilder\datasource\users | 0       |
    And the following "core_reportbuilder > Columns" exist:
      | report    | uniqueidentifier |
      | My report | user:username    |
      | My report | user:lastname    |
      | My report | user:firstname   |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email              |
      | user01   | Alice     | Zebra    | user01@example.com |
      | user02   | Zoe       | Aardvark | user02@example.com |
