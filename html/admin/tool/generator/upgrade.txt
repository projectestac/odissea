=== 3.11.4 ===

* Function tool_generator_testplan_backend::create_users_file() now supports to pass the size of the testing plan,
  that needs to be equal or smaller than the size of the generated site. That's used to effectively restrict the
  exported number of users to the number of threads the jmeter plan will have (previously all the enrolled users
  were being exported, with that leading to "false" loops (users not really looping X times).

=== 3.7 ===

* Function tool_generator_testplan_backend::get_course_options() is removed, the 'course' form element is used instead.
