  Scenario: Course Activity report show subsections' information
    Given I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    When I navigate to "Reports > Activity report" in current page administration
    Then I should see "First page" in the "generaltable" "table"
    And "Subsection" "table_row" should appear before "Last page" "table_row"
    And "Page in Subsection 1" "table_row" should appear before "Last page" "table_row"
