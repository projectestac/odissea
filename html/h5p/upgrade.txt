This files describes API changes in core libraries and APIs,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 3.11 ===
* Added $skipcapcheck parameter to H5P constructor, api::create_content_from_pluginfile_url() and
api::get_content_from_pluginfile_url() to let skip capabilities check to get the pluginfile URL.
* Added new field "enabled" to h5p_libraries to let define if a content type is enabled (1) or not (0).
For now, only runnable content-types can be disabled/enabled. When a content-type is disabled, their
contents are not displayed and no new contents using it can be created/uploaded.
Some extra methods have been added to the api too in order to support this field:
- set_library_enabled
- is_library_enabled
- is_valid_package
* The third-party library h5p/h5plib/v124/core has been updated to version 1.24.2.

=== 3.10 ===
* Added a new cache for h5p_library_files (MDL-69207)

=== 3.9 ===
* A new plugintype has been created, h5plib, for having installed more
than one H5P library version.
* H5P third-party libraries have been moved from /lib/h5p to h5p/h5plib/v124,
as an h5plib plugintype.
* H5P Editor PHP library added to h5plib v124 plugin.
