    @template core_h5p/h5pembed

    This template will render the embed code shown in the H5P content embed popup.
    H5P implements iframe autoheight but if the content is not available it does
    not work and we need ensure a minimum height using javascript. Otherwise the user
    will not see the error.

    Variables required for this template:
    * embedurl - The URL with the H5P file to embed
    * editurl - The URL for the edit button; if it's empty, the edit button won't be displayed.

    Example context (json):
    {
        "embedurl": "http://example.com/h5p/embed.php?url=testurl"
    }

}}
<iframe src="{{embedurl}}" name="h5player" width=":w" height=":h"
   allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="h5p-player w-100 border-0"
   style="height: 0px;" id="{{uniqid}}-h5player">
</iframe>

{{#editurl}}
    <a href="{{editurl}}">{{#str}}editcontent, core_h5p{{/str}}</a>
{{/editurl}}
