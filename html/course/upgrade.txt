This files describes API changes in /course/*,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 4.1 ===
* The function course_modchooser() has been finally deprecated and can not be used anymore. Please use
  course_activitychooser() instead.
* A critical accessibility issue is been found (MDL-74800) at the output class
  core_courseformat\output\local\content\cm\cmname. To solve the problem this output element is not
  rendered anymore using inplace_editable but using a regular named_templatable interface.
  Some format plugins that override the deprecated renderer method course_section_cm_name can be affected.
  Check the current course_section_cm_name code to see how to render it properly.

=== 4.0 ===
* All activity icons have been replaced with black monochrome icons. The background
colour for these icons is defined using a new 'FEATURE_MOD_PURPOSE' support variable in the module lib.php file
Available purpose types are:
  - MOD_PURPOSE_COMMUNICATION
  - MOD_PURPOSE_ASSESSMENT
  - MOD_PURPOSE_COLLABORATION
  - MOD_PURPOSE_CONTENT
  - MOD_PURPOSE_ADMINISTRATION
  - MOD_PURPOSE_INTERFACE
  - MOD_PURPOSE_OTHER
The colours for these types are defined in theme/boost/scss/moodle/variables.scss
* The format_base is now deprecated. Use core_courseformat\base instead.

renderer and course format renderer:

  - core_courseformat\output\local\content\section: to render a section
  - core_courseformat\output\local\content\cm: to render an activity card inside a section
  - core_courseformat\output\local\content\cm\*: to render parts of the course structure
  - core_courseformat\output\local\content\section\*: to render parts of the course section
* The previous format renderer page_title method has been moved to course_format::page_title
* New format renderer methods to interact with the new output components:
  - render: override the default templatable mustache location for the new course components.

    action events.
* The following functions have been deprecated in favour the tertiary navigation constructs:
  - management_heading
  - course_search_form
  - print_course_request_buttons
* New page_setup() method in the core_course_category class. This method can be used for a general page setup in the course

* A new callback xxx_coursemodule_definition_after_data that allows plugins to extend activity forms after the data is set.
* \core_course_renderer::course_section_cm_completion() has been deprecated. It is not being used anymore and is being replaced by
  \core_renderer::activity_information().
* New Behat steps for checking activity date information in the \behat_course class:
