  Scenario: Show / hide section icon functions correctly
    Given I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    When I hide section "1"
    Then section "1" should be hidden
    And section "2" should be visible
    And section "3" should be visible
    And I hide section "2"
    And section "2" should be hidden
    And I show section "2"
    And section "2" should be visible
    And I hide section "3"
    And I show section "3"
    And I hide section "3"
    And section "3" should be hidden
    And I reload the page
    And section "1" should be hidden
    And all activities in section "1" should be hidden
    And section "2" should be visible
    And section "3" should be hidden
    And all activities in section "1" should be hidden
    And I log out
    And I log in as "student1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And section "1" should be hidden
    And all activities in section "1" should be hidden
