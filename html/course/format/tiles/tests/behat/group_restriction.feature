    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I click on ".availability-item .availability-eye img" "css_element"
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I press "Save and return to course"

    And I wait until the page is ready
    #  We used to say "And I follow "Collapse all"" but course index includes that too we have to use element ID now.
    And I follow "collapsesections"
