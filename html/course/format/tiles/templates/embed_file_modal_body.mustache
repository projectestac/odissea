    @template format_tiles/embed_file_modal_body

    Icon picker single icon template.

    The purpose of this template is to render a modal window which can be used
    to display an embedded file (i.e. a PDF)

    The modal is rendered without the <object> (PDF) in its body, as this will be added
    by JS when the user clicks to view the item (whn the embed_file_object template is used)

    Classes required for JS:
    * none

    Data attributes required for JS:
    * none

    Context variables required for this template:
        * id - id of the course module
        * objectType - the object type for the <object> tag's type field e.g. 'text/html'
        * width - width of the item
        * height - height of the item

    Example context (json):
    {
        "id": 123,
        "objectType": "application/pdf",
        "width": 800,
        "height": 600
    }
}}
{{#description}}<div class="p-3">{{{description}}}</div>{{/description}}
<object id="resourceobject_{{id}}" class="resourceobject" data="{{config.wwwroot}}/course/format/tiles/mod_view.php?cmid={{cmid}}{{#cachebustparam}}&t={{cachebustparam}}{{/cachebustparam}}" type="{{objectType}}"
        width="{{#width}}{{width}}{{/width}}{{^width}}800{{/width}}"
        height="{{#height}}{{height}}{{/height}}{{^height}}600{{/height}}">
    {{! the size is hardcoded in the object obove intentionally because it is adjusted by JS - see $("#page-content").on("click", ".launch-tiles-cm-modal"}}
    {{! data field and value field are left blank as they are populated with the URL also by JS (lazy loaded to avoid unnecessary downloads) }}
    {{! note that if it's not a PDF, Moodle will generally use an iframe not an object - see resourcelib.php  - but does not apply here}}
