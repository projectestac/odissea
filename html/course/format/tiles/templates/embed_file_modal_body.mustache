    @template format_tiles/embed_file_modal_body

    Icon picker single icon template.

    The purpose of this template is to render a modal window which can be used
    to display an embedded file (i.e. a PDF)

    The modal is rendered without the <object> (PDF) in its body, as this will be added
    by JS when the user clicks to view the item (whn the embed_file_object template is used)

    Classes required for JS:
    * none

    Data attributes required for JS:
    * none

    Context variables required for this template:
        * id - id of the course module
        * objectType - the object type for the <object> tag's type field e.g. 'text/html'
        * width - width of the item
        * height - height of the item

    Example context (json):
    {
        "id": 123,
        "objectType": "application/pdf",
        "width": 800,
        "height": 600
    }
}}
