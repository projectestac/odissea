    @template format_tiles/single_section_page

    Single section page template.

    The purpose of this template is to render a single section page
    of the course i.e. what a user would expect if they visited
    wwwroot/course/view.php?id=2&section=3

    Either this or multi_section_page will be the first template called
    when the user launches a page from PHP (usually it will be multi_ that is called)

    If the user has javascript enabled, and is not editing, it is likey that this template
    will not be used at all, as the user will never access a URL like wwwroot/course/view.php?id=2&section=3
    Instead they will access multi_section_page from PHP and then each section will be added to that by AJAX using
    the single_section template directly, so bypassing the below

    Classes required for JS:
    * none

    Data attributes required for JS:
    * none

    Context variables required for this template:
        * from_ajax
        * section_zero
        * editing

    Example context (json):
       {
           "from_ajax": 0,
           "section_zero": [],
           "editing": 0,
