    @template format_tiles/icon_picker_photo

    Icon picker single photo template.

    The purpose of this template is to render a single tile background photo for the icon picker
    window, which itself is rendered from the icon_picker_modal template.
    We do not populate the src element of the img immediately as we don't want to load all images at once.
    The src element will be populated from JavaScript.

    Classes required for JS:
    * none

    Data attributes required for JS:
    * none

    Context variables required for this template:
        * filename - file name of the image
        * contextid - the course context id
        * sectionid - 123
        * filepath - the pluginfile path fragment
        * id - the id in the file table

    Example context (json):
    {
        "wwwroot": "https://moodle.org",
        "filename": "grapes.png",
        "contextid": "223",
