    Given I navigate to "View > Single view" in the course gradebook
    And I click on "Grade items" "link" in the ".page-toggler" "css_element"
    When I click on ".search-widget[data-searchtype='grade']" "css_element"
    Then I confirm "Test assignment one" in "grade" search within the gradebook widget exists
    And I confirm "Test assignment two" in "grade" search within the gradebook widget exists
    And I set the field "Search grade items" to "two"
    And I wait "1" seconds
    And I confirm "Test assignment two" in "grade" search within the gradebook widget exists
    And I confirm "Test assignment one" in "grade" search within the gradebook widget does not exist
