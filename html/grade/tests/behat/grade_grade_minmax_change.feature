  In order to verify existing grades are modified as expected
  As an teacher
  I need to modify a grade item with exiting grades
  I need to ensure existing grades are modified in an expected manner

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:

      | Course 1 | C1 | 0 | 1 |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email | idnumber |

    And I am on the "Course 1" "grades > gradebook setup" page logged in as "teacher1"
    And I choose the "Add grade item" item in the "Add" action menu
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Item name | Manual item 1 |

    And I click on "Save" "button" in the "New grade item" "dialogue"

      | Maximum grade | 10 |
    And I navigate to "View > User report" in the course gradebook
