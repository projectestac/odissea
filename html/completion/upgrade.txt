information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 3.11 ===

  - activity_completion_condition_displayed_as()
    - Given the "<Completion condition>" completion condition of "<Activity name>" is displayed as "<Status>"
  - activity_should_have_the_completion_condition()
    - Given "<Activity name>" should have the "<Condition name>" completion condition
  - manual_completion_button_displayed_as()
    - Given the manual completion button of "<Activity name>" is displayed as "<Status>"
  - the_manual_completion_button_for_activity_should_be_disabled()
    - Given the manual completion button for "<Activity name>" should be disabled
  - there_should_be_no_completion_for_activity()
    - Given there should be no completion information shown for "<Activity name>"
  - toggle_the_manual_completion_state()
    - Given I toggle the manual completion state of "<Activity name>"
  - overridden_manual_completion_button_displayed_as
    - Given the manual completion button of "<Activity name>" overridden by "<User>" is displayed as "<Status>"

* *_get_completion_state() callback functions have been deprecated and should no longer be used. Plugins that define custom
  completion rules must implement the mod_[modname]\completion\custom_completion class that extends the
  \core_completion\activity_custom_completion base class.

=== 3.7 ===
 * External function core_completion_external::get_activities_completion_status new returns the following additional field:
   - valueused (indicates whether the completion state affects the availability of other content)
 * On the course page, only users with the capability 'moodle/course:isincompletionreports' (students, by default) can now tick the
   completion checkboxes. Teachers no longer get working checkboxes; tey see slightly different icons that indicate whether
   completion is enabled for the activity. These are the same icons which have always been shown to teachers before when the
   enabled the course editing mode.

=== 2.9 ===

* A completed and failed activity counts as a completed activity for
  course completion.
