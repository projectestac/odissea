  In order to be display student scores
  As a user
  I need to properly configure the activity results block

      | teacher1 | C1 | editingteacher |
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on

  Scenario: Try to configure the block to use an activity without grades
    Given the following "activities" exist:
      | activity   | name            | intro          | course | section | idnumber | assignsubmission_file_enabled |

    And the following "blocks" exist:
      | blockname        | contextlevel | reference | pagetypepattern | defaultregion |
      | activity_results | Course       | C1        | course-view-*   | side-pre      |
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I configure the "Activity results" block
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | config_showbest | 1 |
      | config_showworst | 0 |
      | config_gradeformat | Percentages |
      | config_nameformat | Display full names |
    And I press "Save changes"
    When I am on the "Test assignment" "assign activity editing" page
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | id_grade_modgrade_type | None |
    And I press "Save and return to course"
    Then I should see "Error: the activity selected uses a grading method that is not supported by this block." in the "Activity results" "block"
