Feature: Add URL to main menu block
  In order to add helpful resources for students
  As a admin
  I need to add URLs to the main menu block and check it works.

  @javascript
  Scenario: Add a URL in menu block and ensure it appears
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And I am on site homepage
    And I turn editing mode on
    And I add the "Main menu" block
    And the following "activity" exists:
      | activity    | url                   |
      | course      | Acceptance test site  |
      | name        | reference link        |
      | intro       | mooooooooodle         |
      | externalurl | http://www.moodle.com |
      | section     | 0                     |
    When I am on the "reference link" "url activity editing" page
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | id_display | In pop-up |
    And I press "Save and return to course"
    Then "reference link" "link" should exist in the "Main menu" "block"
    And "Add an activity or resource" "button" should exist in the "Main menu" "block"

  @javascript
  Scenario: When the "Main Menu" block is displayed throrought the entire site, adding an URL in a course
    results in adding it in the course and not in the frontpage
    Given the following "course" exists:
      | fullname         | Course 1 |
      | shortname        | C1       |
      | category         | 0        |
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I am on site homepage
    And I turn editing mode on
    And I add the "Main menu" block
    And I configure the "Main menu" block
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Page contexts | Display throughout the entire site |
    And I press "Save changes"
    When the following "activity" exists:
      | activity        | url                   |
      | course          | C1                    |
      | name            | reference link        |
      | intro           | mooooooooodle         |
      | externalurl     | http://www.moodle.com |
      | section         | 0                     |
      | showdescription | 1                     |
    And I am on the "reference link" "url activity editing" page
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | id_display | In pop-up |
    And I press "Save and return to course"
    Then "reference link" "link" should not exist in the "Main menu" "block"
    And I should see "mooooooooodle" in the "region-main" "region"
