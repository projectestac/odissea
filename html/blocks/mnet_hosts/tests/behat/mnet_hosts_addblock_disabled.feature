Feature: Add the network servers block when main feature is disabled
  In order to add the Network servers block to my course
  As a teacher
  It should be added only if the MNet authentication is enabled.

  Scenario: The network servers block is displayed even when mnet authentication is disabled
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Plugins > Authentication > Manage authentication" in site administration
    And I click on "Enable" "icon" in the "MNet authentication" "table_row"
    And the following "blocks" exist:
      | blockname  | contextlevel | reference | pagetypepattern | defaultregion |
      | mnet_hosts | System       | 1         | site-index      | side-pre      |
    When I navigate to "Plugins > Authentication > Manage authentication" in site administration
    And I click on "Disable" "icon" in the "MNet authentication" "table_row"
    And I am on site homepage
    And I turn editing mode on
    Then I should see "Network servers"
