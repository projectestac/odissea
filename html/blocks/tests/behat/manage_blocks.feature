  As a teacher

    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email |
      | teacher1 | teacher | 1 | teacher1@example.com |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:

    And I am on the "Course 1" course page logged in as teacher1
    And I turn editing mode on
    And I configure the "Comments" block
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Display on page types | Any page |
    And I press "Save changes"

  Scenario: Block settings can be modified so that a block apprears on any page
    When I click on "Test survey name" "link" in the "region-main" "region"
    Then I should see "Comments" in the "Comments" "block"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I configure the "Comments" block
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Display on page types | Any course page |
    And I press "Save changes"
    And I turn editing mode off
    And I click on "Test survey name" "link" in the "region-main" "region"
    And I should not see "Comments"

  Scenario: Block settings can be modified so that a block can be hidden
    When I click on "Test book name" "link" in the "region-main" "region"
    And I configure the "Comments" block
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Visible | No |
    And I press "Save changes"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode off
    And I click on "Test book name" "link" in the "region-main" "region"
    Then I should not see "Comments"
