  Scenario: The search should return no courses if I am not enrolled in any
    When I am on the "My courses" page logged in as "student2"
    Then I should see "No courses" in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I set the field "Search courses" in the "Course overview" "block" to "Fake example"
    And I should see "No courses" in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I log out

  Scenario: Single page search
    Given I am on the "My courses" page logged in as "student1"
    And I set the field "Search courses" in the "Course overview" "block" to "Course 0"
    Then I should see "Course 01" in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I should not see "Course 13" in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I log out

  Scenario: Paginated search
    Given I am on the "My courses" page logged in as "student1"
    And I set the field "Search courses" in the "Course overview" "block" to "Course"
    And I should see "Course 01" in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I should not see "Course 13" in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I click on "[data-control='next']" "css_element" in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I wait until ".block_myoverview [data-control='next']" "css_element" exists
    Then I should see "Course 13" in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I should not see "Course 01" in the "Course overview" "block"
