This files describes API changes for code that uses the user API.

=== 3.11 ===

* Added new core_user/form_user_selector JS module that can be used as the 'ajax' handler for the autocomplete form
  element implementing the user selector.
* Added new external function core_user_external::search_identity(). The main purpose of this external function is to
  provide data for asynchronous user selectors and similar widgets. It allows to search users matching the given query
  in their name or other available identity fields.

=== 3.9 ===

* The unified filter has been replaced by the participants filter. The following have therefore been deprecated:
  * Library functions:
    * user_get_participants_sql
    * user_get_total_participants
    * user_get_participants
  * Unified filter renderer (core_user_renderer::unified_filter)
  * Unified filter renderable (\core_user\output\unified_filter)
  * Unified filter JavaScript (core_user/unified_filter.js and core_user/unified_filter_datasource.js)
  * Unified filter template (unified_filter.mustache)

=== 3.6 ===

* The following functions have been finally deprecated and can not be used anymore:
  * useredit_update_picture()
* core_user_external::update_user_preferences() now allows to unset existing preferences values.
  If the preference value field is not set, the preference will be unset.
