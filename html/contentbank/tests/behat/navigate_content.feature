Feature: Navigate to different contexts in the content bank
  In order to navigate easily in the content bank
  I need to be able to view dropdown with all allowed contexts in the content bank

  Background:
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And the following "categories" exist:
      | name  | category | idnumber |
      | Cat 1 | 0        | CAT1     |

      | Course 2 | C2        | CAT2     |
    And I navigate to "H5P > Manage H5P content types" in site administration
    And I upload "h5p/tests/fixtures/filltheblanks.h5p" file to "H5P content type" filemanager
    And I click on "Upload H5P content types" "button" in the "#fitem_id_uploadlibraries" "css_element"
