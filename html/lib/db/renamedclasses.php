/**
 * This file contains mappings for classes that have been renamed so that they meet the requirements of the autoloader.
 *
 * Renaming isn't always the recommended approach, but can provide benefit in situations where we've already got a
 * close structure, OR where lots of classes get included and not necessarily used, or checked for often.
 *
 * When renaming a class delete the original class and add an entry to the db/renamedclasses.php directory for that
 * component.
 * This way we don't need to keep around old classes, instead creating aliases only when required.
 * One big advantage to this method is that we provide consistent debugging for renamed classes when they are used.
