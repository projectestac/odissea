  Scenario: Lesson rescale grade should not be possible when users are graded
    Given I am on the "Test lesson name" "lesson activity" page logged in as teacher1
    And I follow "Add a question page"
    And I set the field "Select a question type" to "Numerical"
    And I press "Add a question page"
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Page title | Numerical question |
      | Page contents | What is 1 + 2? |
      | id_answer_editor_0 | 3 |
      | id_jumpto_0 | End of lesson |
      | id_enableotheranswers | 1 |
      | id_jumpto_6 | Next page |
    And I press "Save page"
    And I log out
    And I am on the "Test lesson name" "lesson activity" page logged in as student1
    And I set the field "Your answer" to "5"
    And I press "Submit"
    And I log out
    And I am on the "Test lesson name" "lesson activity editing" page logged in as teacher1
    And I expand all fieldsets
    Then the "Maximum grade" "field" should be disabled
