  Scenario: Forum rescale grade should not be possible when users are graded
    Given I log in as "student1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I add a new discussion to "Test forum name" forum with:
      | Subject | Discussion subject   |
      | Message | Test post in forum 1 |
    And I log out
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I follow "Test forum name"
    And I navigate to "Edit settings" in current page administration
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I set the field "Ratings > Aggregate type" to "Count of ratings"
    And I set the field "Ratings > Type" to "Point"
    And I press "Save and return to course"
    And I follow "Test forum name"
    And I follow "Discussion subject"
    And I set the field "rating" to "30"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I follow "Test forum name"
    When I navigate to "Edit settings" in current page administration
    And I expand all fieldsets
    Then the "Maximum grade" "field" should be disabled
