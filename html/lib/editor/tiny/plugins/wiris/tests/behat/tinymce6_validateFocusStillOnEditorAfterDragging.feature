  In order to write Mathematical formulas properly
  As an admin
  I need to use the modal window

    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | format |
      | Course 1 | C1        | topics |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user  | course | role           |
      | admin | C1     | editingteacher |

  Scenario: MTMOODLE-100 - Insert formula after moving modal window
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I add a "Page" to section "0" using the activity chooser
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Name | Test MathType for TinyMCE6 on Moodle |
    And I press "Toggle" in "Page content" field in TinyMCE 6 editor
    And I press "MathType" in "Page content" field in TinyMCE 6 editor
    And I wait until MathType editor is displayed
    And I wait "2" seconds
    And I move the MathType editor
    And I wait "1" seconds
    And I set MathType formula to '<math><mfrac><mn>1</mn><msqrt><mn>2</mn><mi>&#x3c0;</mi></msqrt></mfrac></math>'
    And I wait "1" seconds
    And I press accept button in MathType Editor
    And I press "Save and display"
    Then I wait until Wirisformula formula exists
    Then a Wirisformula containing 'square root' should exist
    And Wirisformula should has height 48 with error of 2
