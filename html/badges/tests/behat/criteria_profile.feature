Feature: Award badges based on user profile field
  In order to award badges to users based on completion of their user profile
  As an admin
  I need to add profile completion criteria to badges in the system

  @javascript
  Scenario: Award badge for a uploading a profile picture.
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email           |
      | user1    | First     | User     | first@example.com  |
    And the following "core_badges > Badge" exists:
      | name        | Site Badge                   |
      | status      | 0                            |
      | description | Site badge description       |
      | image       | badges/tests/behat/badge.png |
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Badges > Manage badges" in site administration
    And I click on "Edit" "link" in the "Site Badge" "table_row"
    And I select "Criteria" from the "jump" singleselect
    And I set the field "type" to "Profile completion"
