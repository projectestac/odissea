    When I am on the "Course 1" "enrolled users" page logged in as "teacher1"
    And I click on "Student 1" "link"
    Then I should see "<badgename>"
    And I am on the "Course 1" course page
    # Navigate to Manage Badges page in order to delete the badge
    And I navigate to "Badges > Manage badges" in current page administration
    # Delete the badge
    And I click on "Delete" "icon" in the "<badgename>" "table_row"
    And I press "<deleteoption>"
    And I am on the "Course 1" "enrolled users" page
    And I click on "Student 1" "link"
    # Confirm that Badge 1 is retained as awarded badge but Badge 2 is not
    And I <visibility> see "<badgename>"
    And I am on the "Course 1" course page
    # Navigate to Badges page to confirm that no badges exist, hence, Manage badges would not exist
    And I navigate to "Badges" in current page administration
    # Confirm that badges are sucessfully deleted
    And I should see "There are currently no badges available for users to earn."

      | Badge 1   | Delete and keep existing issued badges   | should     |
      | Badge 2   | Delete and remove existing issued badges | should not |
